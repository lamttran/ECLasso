\usage{
KKTtestfct(
  par_guess,
  family = c("logistic", "cox"),
  lambda,
  x,
  y = NULL,
  censor = NULL,
  C = matrix(1, nrow = 1, ncol = ncol(x)),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{par_guess}{The guess of the regression coefficients}

\item{family}{The type of model. For now, only logistic and Cox models are supported}

\item{lambda}{The value of the lasso penalty}

\item{x}{The design matrix}

\item{y}{The response vector}

\item{censor}{If using a Cox model, the censoring vector}

\item{C}{The linear constraint(s), by default a 1 by p matrix}

\item{trace}{If false, returns true/false output for KKT conditions. If true, returns that and
which predictors failed the KKT conditions, which are added to later candidate subsets.}
}
\description{
This function checks if the proposed solution satisfies the KKT conditions for optimality
